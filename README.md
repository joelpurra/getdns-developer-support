# [`getdns`](https://getdnsapi.net/) developer support library [getdns-developer-support](https://github.com/joelpurra/getdns-developer-support)

Helper scripts and other developer notes for those working with or on [getdns](https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns), [getdns-node](https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns-node) and [related repositories](https://github.com/getdnsapi), dumped into a repository in the case that they might be of use to someone else. See [getdnsapi.net](https://getdnsapi.net/) for additional `getdns` information.

- Most scripts are only developed to work on a specific setup -- specifically mine at the time of writing.
- Some scripts are single-run, but might be repurposed in some way.
- There are no guarantees you'll find any of this useful, as documentation might be lacking.
- Patches and new scripts are welcome!
